$: chmod a+x ~/bin/repo

Download the BSP source:

[source,console]
$: PATH=${PATH}:~/bin
$: mkdir ~/am57xx-yocto
$ cd ~/am57xx-yocto
$ repo init -u https://github.com/koo7lee/am57xx-bsp-platform.git -b morty
$ repo sync -j4

At the end of the commands you have every metadata you need to start work with.
